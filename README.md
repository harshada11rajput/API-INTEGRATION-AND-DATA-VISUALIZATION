Project Description:
This Python script offers a simple yet practical approach to career guidance and university recommendations based on a student's field of interest. It demonstrates how to integrate with a public API and visualize data using Matplotlib.
Overview:
1.User Input for Interest Area:
-The script begins by asking the user to input their area of interest: Science, Arts, or Commerce.
-Based on the input, it suggests a list of relevant courses tailored to that field.
2.API Integration â€“ Fetching University Data:
-The script integrates with the Hipolabs Universities API, querying a list of universities in India.
-It extracts and displays the names of the top 5 universities returned by the API.
3.Data Visualization:
-A bar chart is generated using Matplotlib to represent the suggested universities.
-Although the chart uses placeholder values for demonstration, it provides a visual summary of the university options.
